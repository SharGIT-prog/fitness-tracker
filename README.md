This is a fitness tracker, whose objectives are to monitor daily milestones and to help maintain consistency over a period of time until desired goals are achieved.

This is a small project I created to experiment with Django, exploring its features and workflows.  
The goal was to get hands-on practice with:

- Setting up a Django project and apps  
- Working with models, views, and templates  
- Understanding how routing and the admin panel work  
- Experimenting with basic database interactions  

# Tech Stack
- Python
